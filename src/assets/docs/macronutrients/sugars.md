### Simple carbohydrates

Simple carbohydrates are carbohydrate with only one sugar unit, `monoscacharides` (_glucose_, _fructose_, and _galactose_), and with two sugar units, `disaccharides` 
(_sucrose_, _lactose_, and _maltose_). They are reffered to as sugars. As a rule of a thumb, every compound that ends with "-oze" is a sugar.

The only natural sugars fructose, maltose, and lactose, whereas the rest of them are "added sugars" or sweeteners. Although they are chemically identical, "added sugars" have no nutritional 
values and are used in the majority of processed foods for preservation.

Because the body is able to synthesize glucose from protein and fats, sugars are non-essential nutrients.

## Digestion and absorption
Sugar digestion begins in the mouth in the presence of saliva and ends in the intestine, where they are absorbed immediately. They balso create an acid medium, hence, it is recommended to not be 
combined with any other nutrient.
Because of their simple form, they are very rapidly absorbed, which causes fast increase of glucose levels (high glicemic index) in the blood and, as a result, high insulin levels, the hormone 
that regulates glucose in the blood.

Thus, excess glucose at once (high glycemic index), leads to high amounts of insuline release, fat storage, and weight gain. Also, long term insulin spikes damage the pancreas, the organ 
responsable for insulin secretion, and increases the risk of type II diabetes, along with other health problems.

### Functions and benefits
- energy supply.

### Disease preventions
Sugars don't prevent any disease.

### Excess
- heart disease;
- type II diabetes;
- high blood pressure (hypertension);
- obesity;
- alzheimer's disease;
- addiction;
- hyperactivity;
- tooth decay;
- osteoporosis;
- depression.

## Food sources
- _fruit_, _milk_, _desserts_, _syrups_, _soft drinks_, _cookies_, _candy_, and _processed foods_.

### Food combining
Sugars shouldn't be combined with any food.

### Average recomended intake
Reduce sugar intakes as much as you can, preferably to 5% of your daily energy intakes (25 grams for 2000 kcal/day).
