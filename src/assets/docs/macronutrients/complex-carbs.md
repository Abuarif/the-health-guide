# Complex carbohydrates

Complex carbohydrate are carbohydrates whith complex sugar unit branches. The two groups of complex carbohydrates are `oligosaccharides` (more than three units) and 
`polysaccharides` (more than ten units).

Polysaccharides are the most predominant type of carbohydrates in the body, hence, they are twh only types of carbohydrates that provide 
benefits to the human body. _Starches_, _glycogen_, and _dietary fiber_ are the most important polysaccharides.

Starch is the most predominant type of complex carbohydrate found in foods, glycogen is used as energy storage in the liver and muscles, whereas fiber improves the 
overal health of the digestive system. Though, complex carbohydrates are considered essential nutrient, because the body cand provide its necesarry energy supplies 
from protein and fats.

## Digestion and absorption
Raw starch is very hard to digest and happens only in the colon, whereas cooked starch is much more easier to digest and to absorb.
Complex carbohydrate dygestion begins in the mouth and continues in the intestine, and requires the alkaline medium, hence, it is not recommended to combine them with other 
nutrients that require or generate an acid medium, like animal protein, fat, and acid fruits. The enzyme ptyalin, that creates the alkaline medium, is neutralized in acid medium.
"Added sugars" also create an acid medium by generating a large amount of saliva secretion in the mouth.
