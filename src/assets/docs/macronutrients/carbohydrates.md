# Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates or _carbs_ are organic compounds made of sugar units (_saccharides_) and they serve as the primary energy source of the body. According to thei sugary units, carbohydrates 
are classified in four groups: `monosaccharides`, `disaccharides`, `oligosaccharides`, and `polysaccharides`. The first two groups are also reffered to as `simple carbohydrates` or [Sugars](sugars.md), 
whereas the latter are considered complex [carbohydrates](complex-carbs.md), because of their complex sugary unit branches. 

Glucose, a monosaccharide, is the major fuel for cells and it can be obtained from either macronutrient: carbs, fats, and protein, Thus, although they are the most common and 
primary source of energy, carbohydratesa are not esserntial for the human body, because we can obtain our energy requirements from fats and protein.

Cells in the central nervous system (e.g. _neurons_) and cells the require aerobic glycolysis (e.g. _red blood cells_) are the only cells that have an absolute requirement for glucose.

### Digestion and absorption
Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth in the presents of silava and then continues in the intestine. The more complex the carbs, the more it takes to break down the sugar units, 
to be converted into glucose, and be absrobed.

Sugars and complex carbohydrates are digested differently, though. Sugars trigger large amounts of saliva secretion, which generates an acid medium and are also digested very fast, because 
they have only one and two respectively sugary units. On the other hand, complex carbohydrates are digested slowly and required an alkaline medium and the enzyme ptyalin to be digested, which 
is neutralized in acid medium.

Thus, combining sugars and complex carbs is a bad idea for two reaons:
- the enzyme required for complex carbs is destroyed;
- complex carbs slow-down digestion which causes sugars to ferment in the intestine leading to bloating and acid.

As mentioned earlier, the more complex the sugary structure, the slower the digestion rate, and the lower the glucose levels in the blood 
(glycemic index) at once. Glucose in the blood is regulated by insulin, which acts like a "gate-keeper" for cells to absorb the necesarry fuel from the blood. It also opens the "gates" 
for glucose to be absrobed by adypocites (fat cells) when present in large amounts in the blood. 

Thus, excess glucose at once (high glycemic index), leads to high amounts of insuline release, fat storage, and weight gain. Also, long term insulin spikes damage the pancreas, the organ 
responsable for insulin secretion, and increases the risk of type II diabetes, along with other health problems.
