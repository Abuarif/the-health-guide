Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element. Its main function is as component of redox enzymes (oxidases in the reduction of molecular oxygen).

## Absorption
Only 
Copper absorption requires:.
Copper absorption is impaired by: vitamin C, zinc, excess molybdenum.

## Functions
	• Antioxidant Protection
	• Bone and Tissue Integrity
	• Energy Support
	• Cholesterol Balance
Iron absorption
synthesis of hemoglobin and red blood cells. Needed for integrity of joints and nerves. Necessary for formation of elastin. Aids with production of enzymes needed for respiration, protein metabolism, healing process, hair and skin pigment, oxidation of Vitamin C and iron absorption. 

## Deficiency
general weakness, impaired respiration, lower collagen and lower white blood cell formation, retarded growth, skin ores, pernicious anemia, and respiratory problems.

## Excess
Alzheimer's disease
