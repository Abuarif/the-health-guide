# Protein (Amino acids)
Proteins are the material of which all the machinery and all the workers in our big factory (body), that maintain all the metabolic functions and struggle to keep us healthy, are made of. Proteins are the buildings blocks of every tiny cell in our body.
Proteins are also groups of amino acids structured together to perform specific functions. Thus, we may conclude that `amino acids are the building blocks of each cell`. We are amino acids, hence, they are critical for our health.

There are 20 amino acids, from which only 11 can be formed by the body on its own (Non-essential amino acids); the rest must be provided through nutrition (`Essential amino acids`).

## Essential amino acids
- __Histidine__;
- __Isoleucine__;
- __Leucine__;
- __Lysine__;
- __Methionine__;
- __Phenylalanine__;
- __Threonine__;
- __Tryptophan__;
- __Valine__.

### Non-essential amino acids
- Alanine
- Arginine
- Asparagine
- Aspartic acid
- Cysteine
- Glutamic acid
- Glutamine
- Glycine
- Proline
- Serine
- Tyrosin

## Absorption
Proteins are denaturated by stomach acid and afterwards are hydrolyzed by enzymes in the intestine. Amino acids require Vitamin B6 and Vitamin C 
for metabolism. Also, amino acid are required by all metabolic processes in the human body.
