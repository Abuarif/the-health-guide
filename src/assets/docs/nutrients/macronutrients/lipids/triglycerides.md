# Triglycerides (Fatty acids)

Tryglicerides, Fatty acids, or, simply, Fats are the major type of lipids found in food and our body (95%). They are made of chains of carbon attached to hydrogen molecules. The less hydrogen molecules, the greater the number of double bonds between carbons, and the lower the saturation. Hence, fats are classified according to their degree of saturation.

## Cis monounsaturated fatty acids
Monounsaturated fats have only one hydrogen molecule removed, thus, one double bond between carbon atoms. They can be produced by the body, hence, __they are non-essential__. They consist of:

- `Omega-7 fatty acids`;
- `Omega-9 fatty acids`.

### Food sources
- Sunflower oil;
- Hazelnut oil;
- Canola oil;
- Olive oil;
- Avocado oil;
- Almond oil;
- Fish oil;
- Sunflower seeds;
- Olives;
- Avocado;
- Nuts;
- Egg yolk;
- Meats.

## Cis polyunsaturated fatty acids
Polyunsaturated fats have more than one hydrogen molecule removed, thus, many double bonds between carbon atoms. They contain __the only essential fats__:

- `Omega-3 fatty acids`;
- `Omega-6 fatty acids`.

> __`Alpha-Linolenic acid` (fatty acid from the Omega-3 group) and `Linoleic acid` (fatty acid from the Omega-6 group) are the only fats the body cannot produce by itself. Thus, they are essential.__

### Food sources
- Safflower oil;
- Grapeseed oil;
- Flaxseed oil;
- Walnut oil;
- Poppyseed oil;
- Soybean oil;
- Hemp oil;
- Sunflower oil;
- Fish oil;
- Flaxseeds;
- Walnuts;
- Fish oil;
- Hemp seeds;
- Sunflower seeds;
- Poppy seeds.

## Saturated fatty acids
Saturated fats have all hydrogen molecules attached, thus, no double bonds between carbon atoms. They can be produced by the body, hence, __they are non-essential__.

> Saturated fats raise low-density

## Food sources
- Palm oil;
- Refined coconut oil;
- Butter;
- Red meat;
- Dairy.

## Trans fatty acids
Trans fats are unsaturated fats that have been forcely hidrogenated (saturated) for greater preservation. They are found in processed and comercial products.

### Food sources
- Industrial oil;
- Margarine;
- Shortening;
- Cookies;
- Crackers;
- Popcorn;
- Candies;
- Potato chips;
- Fast foods;
- Comercial meat.

Fats are insoluble in water so they require additional help to be taken into the bloodstream and transported throughout the body. Thus, after digestion, all lipids are reorganized and are bound to proteins, forming `Lipoproteins`. They are best known as `Blood (serum) cholesterol.`

Lipoproteins are classified according to the number of proteins (protein density). The more proteins, the greater the density and, the greater the number of lipids they are able to carry. They are:
- `High-density lipoproteins (HDL)`;
- `Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL)`;
- `Low-density lipoproteins (LDL)`; 
- `Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL)`;
- `Ultra low-density lipoproteins (ULDL or Chylomicrons)`.

Lipoproteins with higher protein density act as "garbage collectors" and pick up the lipid wastes that remain throughout the blood vessels and take them back to the liver to be reused, whereas those with lower density carry lipids from the intestines and the liver throughout the body, hence, increasing the risk of wastes and deposits on blood vessels. Thus, HDL is usually called `"Good cholesterol"`, and LDL is called `"Bad cholesterol"`.

> __Saturated fats and Trans fats increase LDL levels in the blood, whereas unsaturated fats increase HDL levels in the blood and, thus, decrease LDL levels__.

Saturated fats not only increase LDL levels, but also inhibit their receptors. This makes blood cholesterol remain unused and deposit on the blood vessels.

## Watch out's
> __Dietary cholesterol from animal foods is not the same with blood cholesterol.__
- Limit saturated fat intake to less than 10% daily energy intake.
- Eliminate completley trans fat intake.
- Excess Saturated fats cause:
    - Cardiovascular system damage (Blood vessels, Heart);
    - Weight gain.

- Trans fats consumption cause:
    - Cell membrane damage;
    - Cell nucleus (DNA) damage;
    - Cardiovascular system damage (Blood vessels, Heart);
    - Weight gain.
