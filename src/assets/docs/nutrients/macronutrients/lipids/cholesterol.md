# Cholesterol
Cholesterol is a special type of lipid. It is a sterol (steroid alcohol) specific to animals and, thus, to humans, called `Zoosterol`. Sterols in plants are called `Phytosterols`. Phytosterols compete with cholesterol for absorption and also reduce levels of LDL.

# Why are saturated fats bad ?

Fats are insoluble in water so they require additional help to be taken into the bloodstream and transported throughout the body. Thus, after digestion, all lipids are reorganized and are bound to proteins, forming `Lipoproteins`. They are best known as `Blood (serum) cholesterol.`

Lipoproteins are classified according to the number of proteins (protein density). The more proteins, the greater the density and, the greater the number of lipids they are able to carry. They are:
- `High-density lipoproteins (HDL)`;
- `Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL)`;
- `Low-density lipoproteins (LDL)`; 
- `Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL)`;
- `Ultra low-density lipoproteins (ULDL or Chylomicrons)`.

Lipoproteins with higher protein density act as "garbage collectors" and pick up the lipid wastes that remain throughout the blood vessels and take them back to the liver to be reused, whereas those with lower density carry lipids from the intestines and the liver throughout the body, hence, increasing the risk of wastes and deposits on blood vessels. Thus, HDL is usually called `"Good cholesterol"`, and LDL is called `"Bad cholesterol"`.

> __Saturated fats and Trans fats increase LDL levels in the blood, whereas unsaturated fats increase HDL levels in the blood and, thus, decrease LDL levels__.

Saturated fats not only increase LDL levels, but also inhibit their receptors. This makes blood cholesterol remain unused and deposit on the blood vessels.

Trans fats also reduce levels of HDL.

> To have an idea how lipids look like on blood vessels, imagine how a pan looks like after frying meat or how pipes clogged with greese look like.
