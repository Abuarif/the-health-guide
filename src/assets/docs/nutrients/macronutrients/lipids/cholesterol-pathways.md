After digestion, lipids (triglycerides, cholesteryl esters, phospholipids, fatty acids, and cholesterol) need to be carried out of the small intestine throughout the body. The problem is lipids, due to their nature, are not soluble in water. Thus, they require some help to enter the bloodstream and travel to the cells. Fortunately, our body is smart and takes care of everything.

Lipids are organized and packaged in small molecules called `Lipoproteins`. As their name suggest, our lipids couple with proteins, which suround them in hydrophilic capsules (water lovers). You can imagine our lipids now traveling inside a shell of proteins that prevents liquid from entering.

Some lipoproteins carry a greater amount of lipids - are "fatter" - whereas other carry a smaller amount - are "thinner". The "thin" lipoproteins have higher density, because they are smaller and have more proteins than lipids, whereas the "fat" lipoproteins have lower density, because they are wider and have more lipids than proteins. Lipids require more space than proteins; that is why, for instance, body-builders are heavier than overweight people, although they have less body fat.

Based on their density, there are five types of lipoproteins:
- `Chylomicrons` or Ultra low-density lipoproteins (ULDL);
- `Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)`;
- `Intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL)`;
- `Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)`;
- `High-density lipoprotein (HDL)`.

There are two ways cells can aquire their needed lipids: either from the small instine through dietary intake (externally), either made by the liver (internall), never from both.

Lipids from the small intestine travel as chylomicrons throughout the body (exogeneus pathway), whereas lipids from the liver travel as VLDL.

## Chylomicrons

Chylomicrons are the ones who carry triglycerides, cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters from the small intestine to the cells. After they have been exhausted of their lipid contents, they become chylomicron remnants (wastes) and go back to the liver to be reused (recycling).

## VLDL
When cells require cholesterol and there is none from dietary intake, the liver produces cholesterol from its resources and packages it into VLDL's along with leftovers from earlier recycling processes and sends it to the cells.
