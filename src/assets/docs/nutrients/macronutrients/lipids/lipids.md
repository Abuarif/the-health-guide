# Lipids (Fats)
Lipids or Fats are macronutrients that serve as secondary energy source in abscence of carbohydrates. Lipids are classified in three groups:

- `Triglycerides (Fatty acids)`: _Monounsaturated fatty acids_, _Polyunsaturated fatty acids_, _Saturated fatty acids_, and _Trans fatty acids_;
- `Phospholipids` - Cellular membrane health (Communication and Protection);
- `Sterols` - Hormone formation and Neurotransmitter release (Cellular signaling).

> __`Alpha-Linolenic acid (Omega-3 fatty acid)` and `Linoleic acid (Omega-6 fatty acid)`, two polyunsaturated fatty acids, are the only essential lipids__. All other lipids are produced by the body on its own, hence, are non-essential.

## Health support
- `Body temperature`;
- `Cellular membrane health (Protection)`;
- `Cellular signaling (Neurotransmitter release)`;
- `Energy production`;
- `Hormone formation`;
- `Nutrient absorption and transportation`.

## Daily requirements

## Food sources

## Deficiency signs

## Watch out's
- 95% dietary fat is absorbed.
