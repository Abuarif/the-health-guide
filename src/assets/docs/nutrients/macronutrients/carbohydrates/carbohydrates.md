# Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates or, simply, Carbs are the primary energy source for our body, because they provide the fuel - `Glucose` - needed by our cells to accomplish their functions. Yet, our body can obtain glucose by conversion from amino acids and fats, hence, carbohydrates are not essential nutrients. The problem is, if amino acids and fats are used for fuel, then there will be none left for the rest of the important body processes. _It would be like using the machinery and the workers in a factory as energy supply_; there would be nothing left to accomplish the overall purpose of the factory.

Thus, it is better to let our body get its fuel from carbohydrates and let it use amino acids and fat its main processes.

Carbohydrates are chains of sugar units called `Saccharides`, hence, they are classified in two groups based on their structure: 
- `Simple carbohydrates (Sugars)`: _Monosaccharides_ and _Disaccharides_;
- `Complex carbohydrates (Starch and Fiber)`: _Polysaccharides_.

Glucose in the blood is regulated by insulin, a hormone formed by the pancreas.

> __Insulin "feeds" the cells with the glucose they need and stores the excess in tissues__.

When there is too much glucose in the blood at once, insulin converts it to fat (body fat) and glycogen (energy storage in muscles and liver), process known as `Glycolysis`.

On the other hand, when the cells are "hungry", but there is not enough glucose in the blood, glucose is obtained by conversion from the energy storage (bod fat and glycogen), process known as `Gluconeogenesis`, when insulin is not present.

> __Glucose conversion happens only when there is no glucose and insulin in the blood__.

Glucose levels in the blood is called `Glycemic index`. The more complex the carbohydrates, the slower the digestion and absorption of glucose, hence, the lower the glycemic index. Thus, __Simple carbohydrates have high glycemic index, whereas complex carbohydrates have low glycemic index__.

> __Long-term high glycemic index damages the pancreas, the blood vessels, and the heart__.

## Watch out's
Complex carbohydrates are the only type of carbohydrates that bring benefits to our body. 

> __Simple carbohydrates are BAD, complex carbohydrates are GOOD.__
