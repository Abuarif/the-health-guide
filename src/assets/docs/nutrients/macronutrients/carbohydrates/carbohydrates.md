# Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates or, simply, Carbs are macronutrients that serve as __the primary energy source for our body__. They provide the fuel - `Glucose` - needed by our cells to accomplish their functions. 

Yet, our body can obtain glucose by conversion from amino acids and fats, hence, carbohydrates are not essential nutrients. The problem is, if amino acids and fats are used for fuel, then there will be none left for the rest of the important body processes. _It would be like using the machinery and the workers in a factory as energy supply_; there would be nothing left to accomplish the overall purpose of the factory.

> __It is better to let our body get its fuel from carbohydrates and let it use amino acids and fat for their main purpose.__

Carbohydrates are chains of sugar units called `Saccharides`, hence, they are classified in two groups based on their structure: 
- `Simple carbohydrates (Sugars)`: _Monosaccharides_ and _Disaccharides_;
- `Complex carbohydrates (Starch and Fiber)`: _Polysaccharides_.

Glucose in the blood is regulated by `Insulin`, a hormone secreted by the pancreas.

> __Insulin "feeds" the cells with the glucose they need and stores the excess in tissues__.

When there is too much glucose in the blood at once, insulin stores it for later use in form of `Glycogen` (muscles and liver) through `Glycogenesis` and `Adipose tissue` (organs and under the skin) through `Lipogenesis`. On the other hand, when the cells are "hungry", but there is not enough glucose in the blood, glucose is obtained by conversion from the energy deposits (fat and glycogen) or from amino acids (e.g. muscle fibers), process known as `Gluconeogenesis`.

> __Glucose conversion happens only in the presence of `Glucagon` and `Epinephrine (Adrenaline)`, the latter being released during exercise and as a response to fear and in the abscence of insulin__.

Glucose levels in the blood is called `Glycemic index`. The more complex the carbohydrates, the slower the digestion and absorption of glucose, hence, the lower the glycemic index. Thus, __Simple carbohydrates have high glycemic index, whereas complex carbohydrates have low glycemic index__.

Also, high amounts of insulin need to be transported - _pumped_ - through the blood vessels. This creates high tension on the blood vessels and a big task for the heart, not to mention the high amounts of energy cause by glucose which also stimulates the blood flow.

> __Long-term insulin and glucose spikes damage the blood vessels, the heart, the pancreas, and leads to weight gain and, probably, obesity.__
