# Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates or, simply, Carbs are macronutrients that serve as __the primary energy source for our body__. They provide the fuel - `Glucose` - needed by our cells to accomplish their functions. 

Yet, our body can obtain glucose by conversion from amino acids and fats, hence, carbohydrates are not essential nutrients. The problem is, if amino acids and fats are used for fuel, then there will be none left for the rest of the important body processes. _It would be like using the machinery and the workers in a factory as energy supply_; there would be nothing left to accomplish the overall purpose of the factory.

> __It is better to let our body get its fuel from carbohydrates and let it use amino acids and fat for their main purpose.__

Carbohydrates are chains of sugar units called `Saccharides`, hence, they are classified in two groups based on their structure: 
- `Simple carbohydrates (Sugars)`: _Monosaccharides_ and _Disaccharides_;
- `Complex carbohydrates (Starch and Fiber)`: _Polysaccharides_.

## Health support
- `Energy production`;
- `Mental functions`: Attention, Behaviour, Concentration, Decision making, Language, skills, Learning, Memory, Problem solving, Social, Speaking, Thinking, Understanding;
- `Metabolism`;
- `Positive attitude`;
- `Red blood cells function`.

## Daily requirements
- 50% daily energy intake.

## Food sources

## Watch out's
