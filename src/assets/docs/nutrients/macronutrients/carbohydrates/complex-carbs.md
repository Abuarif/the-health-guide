# Complex carbohydrates (Polysaccharides)
Complex carbohydrates are carbohydrates with long and complex chains of sugar units.

## Glycogen
Glycogen is the form of energy storage in the liver and muscles. It is required as energy source when glucoe levels are low in the blood.

## Starches
Starches are the primary and most common energy source. They offer the greatest amount of energy for long periods of time and not at once like sugars. Thus, they are the only type of carbohydrates required by the body. They are found mostly in grains, which includes breads and pastas, potatoes, and legumes.

## Fiber
Fiber is the indigestable form of carbohydrates found in the skin of fruits and vegetables and in the bran (shell) of seeds and grains. The body cannot digest, nor absorb, fiber, hence, it is not required. Yet, fiber improves nutrient digestion, nutrient absorption, and elimination of intestinal wastes (detoxification).
