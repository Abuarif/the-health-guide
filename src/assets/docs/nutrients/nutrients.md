# Nutrients
Nutrients are organic compounds required by our body to function properly and evolve. The body is able to form some nutrients on its own, these are `Non-essential nutrients`, but the rest must be provided through nutrition, hence, they are `Essential nutrients`.

## Essential nutrients
- __Water__;
- __Oxygen__;
- __Fatty acids__: Omega-3 Fatty acid and Omega-6 Fatty Acid;
- __Amino acids__: Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, and Valine;
- __Vitamins__: Choline, Vitamin A, Vitamin B-Complex, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Vitamin K;
- __Minerals__: Calcium, Chloride, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Molybdenum, Phosphorus, Potassium, Selenium, Sodium, and Zinc.

All body processes require energy. _Our body is a factory and the nutrients are the machinery_ and, like any machinery, it requires fuel to work. Fuel comes from three major nutrients that are required in greater amounts, hence, they are called `Macronutrients`.

### Macronutrients
- __Water__;
- __Oxygen__;
- __Carbohydrates__;
- __Fats (Fatty acids)__;
- __Protein (Amino acids)__ ;

As you may guess, the rest of the essential nutrients, Vitamins and Mineral, are required in lower amounts, hence, they are called `Micronutrients`.

### Micronutrients
- __Vitamins__
- __Minerals__

The summation of all body processes, also known as `Chemical transformations`, that help our body function properly and evolve - _be healthy_ - is called `Metabolism`.

Nutrients should be provided from `Whole foods` and not from supplements, for three reasons:

1. __Supplements are synthetic__: Our digestive system is not genetically designed to digest synthetic compounds. More, synthetic compounds destroy the `Gut flora` that is responsible for correct nutrient absorption. Thus, nutrients from supplements are not absorbed and are eliminated from the body.

2. __Nutrients are a team__: Supplements come with only one or two nutrients and it is not enough (This is why all doctors tell you to take them after meals). Nutrients help each other in their functions, hence, they are involved in all body processes. _If only one of the essential nutrients is missing, a chain reaction happens, and all body processes are interrupted. It's all or nothing_. If you try to provide all essential nutrients from supplements, you destroy your digestive system and put your health at risk.

3. __Supplements cause side effect__: As I said, uur digestive system is not genetically designed to digest synthetic compounds, hence, their are seen as `intruders` in our body and may interfere with the metabolism.

The _key to a healthy body (good metabolism)_ is to ensure provide all the essential nutrients and to ensure they are absorbed as completely as possible by keeping your digestive system, especially your gut flora, healthy. Neither of the essential nutrients is completely absorbed.

## Optimal nutrient absorption
- __No smoking__;
- __Prebiotics__;
- __Probiotics__;
- __Reduced alcohol__;
- __Reduced caffeine__;
- __Reduced pharmaceutical drugs__;
- __Reduced sugars__;
- __Stress management__;
- __Whole organic food__.

Like everything in life, _Moderation is key to perfection_. Thus, although nutrients bring benefits to our body, they can also damage it if they are offered in large amounts. 
Our body is smart and has its own ways to maintain equilibrium, also known as `Homeostasis`. Yet, when the damage is too much at once or for too long time, the body fails to restore homeostasis. As a result, `Disease` occurs and, in critical cases, `Death`.

## Watch out's
- __Alcohol__;
- __Caffeine__;
- __Cholesterol__;
- __Saturated fat__;
- __Salt__;
- __Sugars__;
- __Trans fat__.
