# Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates or _carbs_ are organic compounds made of sugar units (_saccharides_) and they serve as the primary energy source of the body, however they are not considered essential, because they can be synthesized by the human body from fats and protein.
According to their sugar units, carbohydrates are classified in two main groups:

### Simple carbohydrates

`Monoscacharides` (_glucose_, _fructose_, and _galactose_) and `disaccharides` (_sucrose_, _lactose_, and _maltose_) are the simple forms of carbohydrates, 
because they have only one, respectivly two sugar units, hence, they are the easiest to digest and absorb.
Simple carbs are also known as sugars. 

As a rule of a thumb, every compound that ends with "-oze" is a sugar. So the next time you check 
the label and see a wired name ending with an "oze", you will know it is a sugar.

Most sugars in processed foods are not naturally occuring sugars (e.g. fructose, lactose, or maltose), 
but "added sugars" (_white sugar_, _brown sugar_, _raw sugar_, _corn syrup_, _corn-syrup solids_, 
_high-fructose corn syrup_, _malt syrup_, _maple syrup_, _pancake syrup_, _fructose sweetener_, _liquid fructose_, 
_honey_, _molasses_, _anhydrous dextrose_, _crystal dextrose_, etc.).
Although they are chemically identical, "added sugars" have no nutritional values.

Major food sources of added sugars include _soft drinks_, _cakes_, _cookies_, _pies_, _fruit ades_, _fruit punch_, _dairy desserts_, and _candy_.

Consumption of added sugars leads to: cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, weight gain, and obesity.

### Complex carbohydrates
Polysaccharides (_starches_, _glycogen_, and _fiber_) are the complex carbohydrates, because they have more then ten sugar units, thus, they take longer to digest.

## Digestion and absorption
The biggest problem with sugars is that, because of their fast ingesting, they raise the glycemic index high and fast.
