# Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates or _carbs_ are organic compounds made of sugar units (_saccharides_) and they serve as the primary energy source of the body, however they are not considered essential, because they can be synthesized by the human body from fats and protein.

Cells in the central nervous system (e.g. _neurons_) and cells the require aerobic glycolysis (e.g. _red blood cells_) are the only cells that have an absolute requirement for glucose.

According to their sugar units, carbohydrates are classified in two main groups:

### Simple carbohydrates

`Monoscacharides` (_glucose_, _fructose_, and _galactose_) and `disaccharides` (_sucrose_, _lactose_, and _maltose_) are the simple forms of carbohydrates, 
because they have only one and two, respectively, sugar units, hence, they are the easiest to digest and absorb.
Simple carbs are also known as sugars. 

As a rule of a thumb, every compound that ends with "-oze" is a sugar.

Most sugars in processed foods are not naturally occuring sugars (e.g. fructose, lactose, or maltose), 
but "added sugars" or sweeteners.
Although they are chemically identical, "added sugars" have no nutritional values.

Consumption of added sugars leads to: cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, weight gain, and obesity.

### Complex carbohydrates
Polysaccharides (_starches_, _glycogen_, and _fiber_) are the complex carbohydrates, because they have more then ten sugar units, thus, they take longer to digest.
They are the most predominant type of carbohydrates in the body.

Despite its health benefits of prevenitng colon cancer, heart disease, constipation, and obseity, and improving the overal health of the digestive system, 
fiber is not required directly by the human body, because it is not digested and absrobed. Also, excess fiber causes bloating and diarheea.

## Digestion and absorption
Complex carbohydrate dygestion begins in the mouth and continues in the intestine, and requires the alkaline medium, hence, it is not recommended to combine them with other 
nutrients that require or generate an acid medium, like animal protein, fat, and acid fruits. The enzyme ptyalin, that creates the alkaline medium, is neutralized in acid medium.
"Added sugars" also create an acid medium by generating a large amount of saliva secretion in the mouth.

As mentioned earlier, the big difference between simple and complex carbohydrates is in their sugar unit compound, which take different times to be broken down into glucose, the major fuel for body cells. 
The more complex the sugary structure, the slower the digestion rate, and the lower the glucose levels in the blood (glycemic index) at once. Thus, The biggest problem with sugars is they raise the glycemic index rapidly. 

Glucose in the blood is regulated by insulin, which acts like a "gate-keeper" for cells to absorb the necesarry fuel from the blood. It also opens the "gates" for glucose to be absrobed by adypocites (fat cells) when 
present in large amounts in the blood. 

Thus, excess glucose at once (high glycemic index), leads to high amounts of insuline release, fat storage, and weight gain. Also, exhausting the pancreas, the organ that secretes insulin, with high amounts of insulin spikes 
increases the risk of type II diabetes, along with other health problems.

## Food sources

- Sugars: _table sugar_, _syrups_, _malt syrups_, _honey_, _soft drinks_, _cookies_, _candy_, and the majority of _processed foods_;
- Starches: _grains_, _potatoes_, _legumes_, _winter squashes_, _pumpkin_, and _tofu_;
- Fiber: _fruits_, _vegetables_, and _whole grains_.
