# Nutrients

Nutrients are components that are required by living organisms in order to survive and evolve.

Some nutrients may by synthesized by the body (`non-essential`), the rest must be obtained from external sources (`essential`).
According to these requirements, nutrients are also classified in `macronutrients` (required in large amounts) and `micronutrients` (required in small amounts).

Macronutrients are required in large amounts, because they provide the energy (_fuel_) to sustain the metabolic processes. The main macronutrients are: `carbohydrates`, `fats`, and `protein (amino acids)`.
Micronutrients are the _workers_ in the metabolic processes; they build and repair tissues, and also regulate body processes. The main micronutrients are `vitamins` and `minerals`.

Briefly, the major nutrients are __carbohydrates__, __fats__, __protein (amino acids)__, __vitamins__, __minerals__, __water__, and __oxygen__. The only essential nutrients:
- __Water__
- __Oxygen__
- __Essential fatty acids__: [alpha-Linolenic acid (Omega-3 fatty acid)](macronutrients/aLinolenicAcid.md) and [Linoleic acid (Omega-6 fatty acid)](macronutrients/linoleicAcid.md)
- __Essential amino acids__: [Histidine](), [Isoleucine](), [Leucine](), [Lysine](), [Methionine](), [Phenylanaline](), 
[Threonine](), [Triptophan](), [Tyrosine](), and [Valine]()
- __Vitamins__: [Vitamin A](micronutrients/vitamins/vitaminA.md), [Vitamin B1 (Thiamin)](), [Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)](), [Vitamin B3 (Niacin)](), 
[Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic acid)](), [Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)](), [Vitamin B7 (Biotin)](), [Vitamin B9 (Folic acid)](), 
[Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)](), [Vitamin C (Absorbic acid)](), [Vitamin D (D2 and D3)](), [Vitamin E (alpha-Tocopherol)](), 
and [Vitamin K (Phylloquinone)]()
- __Minerals__: [Calcium](), [Chlorine](), [Chromium](), [Cobalt](), [Copper](), [Iodine](), [Magnesium](), [Iron](), 
[Manganese](), [Molybdenum](), [Phophorus](), [Potassium](), [Selenium](), [Sodium](), [Zinc_

Note: Although water and oxygen are required in large amounts and contirbute to all metabolic processes, they are not considered macronutrients, because they are not converted into energy.
