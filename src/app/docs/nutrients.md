# Nutrients

Nutrients are components that are required by living organisms in order to survive and evolve.

Some nutrients may by synthesized by the body (`non-essential`), the rest must be obtained from external sources (`essential`).
According to these requirements, nutrients are also classified in `macronutrients` (required in large amounts) and `micronutrients` (required in small amounts).

Macronutrients are required in large amounts, because they provide the energy (_fuel_) to sustain the metabolic processes. The main macronutrients are: `carbohydrates`, `fats`, and `protein (amino acids)`.
Micronutrients are the _workers_ in the metabolic processes; they build and repair tissues, and also regulate body processes. The main micronutrients are `vitamins` and `minerals`.

Briefly, the major nutrients are: __carbohydrates__, __fats__, __protein (amino acids)__, __vitamins__, __minerals__, __water__, and __oxygen__.

### Essential nutrients:
- __Water__
- __Oxygen__
- __Essential fatty acids__: [alpha-Linolenic acid (Omega-3 fatty acid)](macronutrients) and [Linoleic acid (Omega-6 fatty acid)](macronutrients)
- __Essential amino acids__: [Histidine](macronutrients), [Isoleucine](macronutrients), [Leucine](macronutrients), [Lysine](macronutrients), [Methionine](macronutrients), [Phenylanaline](macronutrients), 
[Threonine](macronutrients), [Triptophan](macronutrients), [Tyrosine](macronutrients), and [Valine](macronutrients)
- __Vitamins__: [Vitamin A](micronutrients/vitamins/vitaminA.md), [Vitamin B1 (Thiamin)](micronutrients/vitamins), [Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)](micronutrients/vitamins), [Vitamin B3 (Niacin)](micronutrients/vitamins), 
[Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic acid)](micronutrients/vitamins), [Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)](micronutrients/vitamins), [Vitamin B7 (Biotin)](micronutrients/vitamins), [Vitamin B9 (Folic acid)](micronutrients/vitamins), 
[Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)](micronutrients/vitamins), [Vitamin C (Absorbic acid)](micronutrients/vitamins), [Vitamin D (D2 and D3)](micronutrients/vitamins), [Vitamin E (alpha-Tocopherol)](micronutrients/vitamins), 
and [Vitamin K (Phylloquinone)](micronutrients/vitamins)
- __Minerals__: [Calcium](micronutrients/minerals), [Chlorine](micronutrients/minerals), [Chromium](micronutrients/minerals), [Cobalt](micronutrients/minerals), [Copper](micronutrients/minerals), [Iodine](micronutrients/minerals), [Magnesium](micronutrients/minerals), [Iron](micronutrients/minerals), 
[Manganese](micronutrients/minerals), [Molybdenum](micronutrients/minerals), [Phophorus](micronutrients/minerals), [Potassium](micronutrients/minerals), [Selenium](micronutrients/minerals), [Sodium](micronutrients/minerals), [Zinc](micronutrients/minerals)

Note: Although water and oxygen are required in large amounts and contirbute to all metabolic processes, they are not considered macronutrients, because they are not converted into energy.

### Be careful with:
- __Alcohol__
- __Cholesterol__
- __Saturated fat__
- __Sodium__
- __Sugars__
- __Trans fat__

These nutrients cause serious health problems when taken in excess. Limit them as much as you can.
