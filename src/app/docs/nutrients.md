# Nutrients

Nutrients are components that are required by living organisms in order to survive and evolve.

Some nutrients may by synthesized by the body (`non-essential`), the rest must be obtained from external sources (`essential`).
According to these requirements, nutrients are also classified in `macronutrients` (required in large amounts) and `micronutrients` (required in small amounts).

Macronutrients are required in large amounts, because they provide the energy (the "fuel") to sustain the metabolic processes.
Micronutrients are the "workers" in the metabolic processes (build and repair tissues, regulate body processes).

The major groups of nutrients are `carbohydrates`, `fats`, `protein (amino acids)`, `vitamins`, `minerals`, `water`, and `oxygen`, but not all of them are essential.
From these groups, the only essential nutrients are:
- `Water`
- `Oxygen`
- `Essential fatty acids`: _alpha-Linolenic acid (Omega-3 fatty acid)_ and _Linoleic acid (Omega-6 fatty acid)_
- `Essential amino acids`: _Histidine_, _Isoleucine_, _Leucine_, _Lysine_, _Methionine_, _Phenylanaline_, 
_Threonine_, _Triptophan_, _Tyrosine_, and _Valine_
- `Vitamins`: [Vitamin A](micronutrients/vitamins/vitaminA.md), _Vitamin B1 (Thiamin)_, _Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)_, _Vitamin B3 (Niacin)_, 
_Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic acid)_, _Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)_, _Vitamin B7 (Biotin)_, _Vitamin B9 (Folic acid)_, 
_Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)_, _Vitamin C (Absorbic acid)_, _Vitamin D (D2 and D3)_, _Vitamin E (alpha-Tocopherol)_, 
and _Vitamin K (Phylloquinone)_
- `Minerals`: _Calcium_, _Chlorine_, _Chromium_, _Cobalt_, _Copper_, _Iodine_, _Magnesium_, _Iron_, 
_Manganese_, _Molybdenum_, _Phophorus_, _Potassium_, _Selenium_, _Sodium_, _Zinc_
