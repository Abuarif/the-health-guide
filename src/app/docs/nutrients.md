# Nutrients

Nutrients are components that are required by living organisms in order to survive and evolve.

Some nutrients may by synthesized by the body (`non-essential`), the rest must be obtained from external sources (`essential`).
According to these requirements, nutrients are also classified in `macronutrients` (required in large amounts) and `micronutrients` (required in small amounts).

Macronutrients are required in large amounts, because they provide the energy (the "fuel") required to sustain the metabolic processes.
Micronutrients are the "workers" in the metabolic processes (build and repair tissues, regulate body processes).

The major groups of nutrients are `carbohydrates`, `fats`, `protein (amino acids)`, `vitamins`, `minerals`, `water`, and `oxygen`, but not all of them are essential.
From these groups, the only essential nutrients are:
- `Water`
- `Oxygen`
- Essential fatty acids: `alpha-Linolenic acid (Omega-3 fatty acid)` and `Linoleic acid (Omega-6 fatty acid)`
- Essential amino acids: `Histidine`, `Isoleucine`, `Leucine`, `Lysine`, `Methionine`, `Phenylanaline`, 
`Threonine`, `Triptophan`, `Tyrosine`, and `Valine`
- Vitamins: [Vitamin A](micronutrients/vitamins/vitaminA.md), `Vitamin B1 (Thiamin)`, `Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)`, `Vitamin B3 (Niacin)`, 
`Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic acid)`, `Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)`, `Vitamin B7 (Biotin)`, `Vitamin B9 (Folic acid)`, 
`Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)`, `Vitamin C (Absorbic acid)`, `Vitamin D (D2 and D3)`, `Vitamin E (alpha-Tocopherol)`, 
and `Vitamin K (Phylloquinone)`
- Minerals: `Calcium`, `Chlorine`, `Chromium`, `Cobalt`, `Copper`, `Iodine`, `Magnesium`, `Iron`, 
`Manganese`, `Molybdenum`, `Phophorus`, `Potassium`, `Selenium`, `Sodium`, `Zinc`
